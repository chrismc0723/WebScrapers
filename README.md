# WebScrapers
This will contain a variety of web scrapers for people to try out.

I have some small web scrapers available to test and at this point in time I am working on a webscraper for a larger website. 
I will provide a version one for this very soon.

The MCU webscraper is a work in progress.
I haven't been able to find a solution for webscraping the marvel website. the goal is for a user to input a character and they recieve links and names of everything that shows up on each search page for that character.
