# WebScrapers
This will contain a variety of web scrapers for people to try out.

I have some small web scrapers available to test and at this point in time I am working on a webscraper for a larger website. 
I will provide a version one for this very soon.
The MCU.py webscraper took longer to build than expected as I intitially tried using BeautifulSoup which wouldn't get all the information I needed. So I tried Selenium but couldn't get that to work either. After thurough testing and several workarounds I was finally able to piece together a solution. 
I will expand on this in the future and potentially implement it into other projects.
