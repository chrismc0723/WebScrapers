# WebScrapers
This will contain a variety of web scrapers for people to try out.

I have some small web scrapers available to test and at this point in time I am working on a webscraper for a larger website. 
I will provide a version one for this very soon.

The MCU webscraper is a work in progress.
the MCU.py I am currently working on. I tried using Beautiful Soup however that wasn't working with my findings and I am also trying Selenium however that doesn't seem to work either. going to research over the weekend to try find a solution.
